        <h1>Things to do when you're bored</h1>
        <p> Do you ever get bored at home? Why am I even asking this question? Of course, you do (unless you're busy with homework)!</p>
        <p> Boredom may be a luxury because you have the free time to spend however you like.
            However, it may seem like there is nothing to do. Or perhaps your options just don't seem interesting enough.
            Thus, we have complied a small list of things to do when boredom hits you.
            Using the navigation bar above, feel free to explore the activities planned out!
